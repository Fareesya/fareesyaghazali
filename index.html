      <h5>Positive Covid-19 Patient</h5>
      <li><p class="w3-text-black">My papa, grandma and me got positive in corona virus that got from my uncle. He came back from KL to hometown and got effected to my auntie who always taking care of my grandma and my papa suddenly who visited her mother which is my grandma got effected and when he back home, glad that I am the only one who got effected instead of my mother and my brothers. Anyways Alhamdulillah very grateful for the recovery from the virus.</p></li><br>
    
      <h5>Online Distance Learning</h5>
      <li><p class="w3-text-black">Online distance learning for sure is not for every students, this method challenge us a lot in using the technology. But so far, this ODL method is the only way to prevent from the increasing the COVID-19 in our country instead of face to face or physical learning class.</p></li><br>

      <h5>As One Of The Korean Pop Stan</h5>
      <li><p class="w3-text-black">I have been listening to kpop genre songs for like almost 8 years since the vibe is match to me very well. People always condemn that listening to kpop songs is because of the idols or the singer who are most likely in Korea are popular as plastic surgery where you can get that perfect visual and appreances of face and body. But in my perception, the lyrics and the melody are the main role of the reasons why I liking and listening to them. Sometimes people express their feelings through songs. Those idols also must have a very hard time to survive for the sake of people beauty standard and try to satisfy everyone by sacrifce ourselves. I have learned a lot ever since become one of the korean pop and korean singers. Everyone in life is struggling. We really should not judge, misunderstanding and make our own assumptions for own on satisfaction.</p></li><br>
    
      <h5>University Life in UiTM Merbok</h5>
      <li><p class="w3-text-black">My college friends and me did not manage to really feel in full diploma life as a university students because of pandemic. But kind of grateful that only in semester 1 and semester 5 we got to back in college even we are still in online learning, otherwise the feelings studying at home and in university are totally different. In form of surroundings and environments.</p></li>
